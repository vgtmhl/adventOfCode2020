# adventOfCode2020
My entries for AdventOfCode 2020 event

I decided to participate at adventOfCode2020 as a fun thing to do on the side, and it quickly consumed most of my free time :P 

I also decided to try to do this in Python, a language with which I have zero professional or academic experience. 
So if you are a Python developer reading this, it's probably trash, but I had a great deal of fun
